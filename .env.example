# This file provides an example of the environment variables needed for this project.
# Copy this file to .env (for production) or .env.local (for development) and fill in the values.

# --- Database Configuration (Mandatory) ---
# The application supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Choose one and uncomment the corresponding line.
# The DATABASE_URL is used by Drizzle ORM to connect to your database.

# Option 1: SQLite
# For local development or simple deployments. The database file will be created at this path.
# The `./data` directory is recommended to align with the Docker volume mount.
DATABASE_URL="file:./data/dev.db"

# Option 2: PostgreSQL
# For production or more robust setups. Replace with your actual connection string.
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"


# --- Recommended ---
# A long, random, and secure secret token to protect the cron job endpoint (`/api/cron/health-check`).
# This is required to enable the automatic reactivation of failed API keys.
CRON_SECRET="your-long-random-secret-token"

# --- Optional ---
# If you need to use a proxy for the Google API, specify its URL here.
# GOOGLE_API_HOST="https://your-proxy-url"
